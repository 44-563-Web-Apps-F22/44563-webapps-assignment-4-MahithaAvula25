    <p class="speech">
        Won't it be a pretty wedding?
        Will not Lisa look delightful?
        Smiles and tears in plenty shedding—
        Which in brides of course is rightful
        One could say, if one were spiteful,
        Contradiction little dreading,
        Her bouquet is simply frightful—
        Still, 'twill be a pretty wedding!
        Oh, it is a pretty wedding!
        Such a pretty, pretty wedding!

    <h5 class="elsa">ELSA.</h5>
    <p class="speech1">If her dress is badly fitting,
        Theirs the fault who made her trousseau.</p>
    <h5 class="bertha">BERTHA.</h5>
    <p class="speech1">If her gloves are always splitting,
        Cheap kid gloves, we know, will do so.</p>

        On one's train one's always treading.</p>

        Still, 'twill be a pretty wedding!</p>

    <h5 class="chorus">CHORUS.</h5>

        Here they come, the couple plighted—
        On life's journey gaily start them.
        Soon to be for aye united,
        Till divorce or death shall part them.

    <p class="speech2">Pretty Lisa, fair and tasty,
        Tell me now, and tell me truly,
        Haven't you been rather hasty?
        Haven't you been rash unduly?
        Am I quite the dashing sposo
        That your fancy could depict you?
        Perhaps you think I'm only so-so?

    <p class="speech2">No, he will not contradict you!</p>
    <h5 class="lisa">LISA.</h5>
    <p class="speech">Who am I to raise objection?
        I'm a child, untaught and homely—
        When you tell me you're perfection,
        Tender, truthful, true, and comely—
        That in quarrel no one's bolder,
        Though dissensions always grieve you—
        Why, my love, you're so much older
        That, of course, I must believe you!
    </p>
    <h5 class="chorus">CHORUS. </h5>
    <p class="speech1">Yes, of course, she must believe you!</p>
    <h5 class="chorus">CHORUS.</h5>
    <p class="speech">
        If he ever acts unkindly,
        Shut your eyes and love him blindly—
        Should he call you names uncomely,
        Shut your mouth and love him dumbly—
        Should he rate you, rightly—leftly—
        Shut your ears and love him deafly.
        Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!
        Thus and thus and thus alone
        Ludwig's wife may hold her own!

    <p class="direction">(appalled)</p>.
    <p class="speech">When two doughty heroes thunder,
        All the world is lost in wonder;
        When such men their temper lose,
        Awful are the words they use!

    <h5 class="lud">LUD.</h5>
    <p class="speech1">Look here, sir—</p>
    <p class="direction">(Makes a face at RUDOLPH.)</p>
    <br>
    <p class="song1"> When you find you're a broken-down critter,
        Who is all of a trimmle and twitter,
        With your palate unpleasantly bitter,
        As if you'd just eaten a pill—
        When your legs are as thin as dividers,
        And you're plagued with unruly insiders,
        And your spine is all creepy with spiders,
        And you're highly gamboge in the gill—
        When you've got a beehive in your head,
        And a sewing machine in each ear,
        And you feel that you've eaten your bed,
        And you've got a bad headache down here—
        When such facts are about,
        And these symptoms you find
        In your body or crown—
        Well, you'd better look out,
        You may make up your mind
        You had better lie down!

        When your lips are all smeary—like tallow,
        And your tongue is decidedly yallow,
        With a pint of warm oil in your swallow,
        And a pound of tin-tacks in your chest—
        When you're down in the mouth with the vapours,
        And all over your Morris wall-papers
        Black-beetles are cutting their capers,
        And crawly things never at rest—
        When you doubt if your head is your own,
        And you jump when an open door slams—
        Then you've got to a state which is known
        To the medical world as "jim-jams"
        If such symptoms you find
        In your body or head,
        They're not easy to quell—
        You may make up your mind
        You are better in bed,
        For you're not at all well!
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="song2">
        Were I a king in very truth,
        And had a son—a guileless youth—
        In probable succession;
        To teach him patience, teach him tact,
        How promptly in a fix to act,
        He should adopt, in point of fact,
        A manager's profession.
        To that condition he should stoop
        (Despite a too fond mother),
        With eight or ten "stars" in his troupe,
        All jealous of each other!
        Oh, the man who can rule a theatrical crew,
        Each member a genius (and some of them two),
        And manage to humour them, little and great,
        Can govern this tuppenny State!

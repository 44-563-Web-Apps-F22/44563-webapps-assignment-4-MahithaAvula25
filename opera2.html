    <h5 class="julia">JULIA</h5>
    <p class="speech1">
        Our duty, if we're wise,
        We never shun.
        This Spartan rule applies
        To every one.
        In theatres, as in life,
        Each has her line—
        This part—the Grand Duke's wife
    <p class="direction">(Oh agony!)</p> is mine!
    A maxim new I do not start—
    The canons of dramatic art
    Decree that this repulsive part
    <p class="direction">(The Grand Duke's wife)

    </p>
    Is mine!
    </p>
    <br>

    <h5 class="lisa">LISA</h5>
    <p class="speech"> Oh, listen to me, dear—
        I love him only, darling!
        Remember, oh, my pet,
        On him my heart is set
        This kindness do me, dear-
        Nor leave me lonely, darling!
        Be merciful, my pet,
        Our love do not forget!
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5 class=julia>JULIA</h5>
    <p class="speech2"> Now don't be foolish, dear—
        You couldn't play it, darling!
        It's "leading business", pet
        And you're but a soubrette.
        So don't be mulish, dear-
        Although I say it, darling,
        It's not your line, my pet—
        I play that part, you bet!
        I play that part—
        I play that part, you bet!

    <p class="direction">(LISA overwhelmed with grief.)</p>
    </p>

    <h5 class="not">NOT</h5>
    <p class="speech1"> The lady's right. Though Julia's engagement
        Was for the stage meant—
        It certainly frees Ludwig from his
        Connubial promise.
        Though marriage contracts—or whate'er you call 'em—
        Are very solemn,
        Dramatic contracts
    <p class="direction">(which you all adore so)</p>
    Are even more so!
    </p>
    <h5 class="all">ALL</h5>
    <p class="speech">That's very true!
    Though marriage contracts, etc.
